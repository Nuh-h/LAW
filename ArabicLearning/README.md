# ArabicLearning

The intention for this project is to be build a website for learning Arabic - in essence, a website for a hypothetical Institute of Arabic. 

The aim is to first cover basic availability of courses, browsing course details and categorising them appropriately. 

Then increase by introducing teachers' and students' views/ui respectively, then manage their interactions and so on. 

This is not a project to be built in a single day or a single month...

## Current Progress
It is now in an exciting phase. Authentication has been added and enabled for both Identity and External Providers.
I have chosen Google and Okta as the external authentication providers for now.

Currently, you are able to log in/out and view courses and resources. The database is ready for courses, timetables, and classes.


Next stage: 
Add screening view to ask if Student or Teacher then delegate roles based on this option. 
Create policies around these roles. 
Form classes and classroom functionalities.
